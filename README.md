# DriverSite README.md

## Project Overview
- The purpose of my project is to compare climate data with the supply and demand, and the profitability of driving occupations. This website is currently in its early stages of creation. 

## Page Descriptions
- Home Page: This page is meant to be the starting point and indrotuctory welcome page of the site. I included a couple sections on this page to explain more about the site to the user. I also included a table to help the user visualize the data in a way that may make more sense to them. Apart from these features, I inlcluded an anchor with a link to the supply and demand page to add functionality.
- Supply and Demand Page: This page is supposed to show visitors supply and demand data in correlation with climation conditions from a variety of geographically distant locations. On this page, I inlcuded a descriptive list to explain more about the different climate conditions. I also added an href link to a doordash site to educate users more on the business and its supply and demand. Lastly I added a button with javascript at the bottom of this page to function as a survey to add more user interactivity to my site.

## Research Summary

### Part 1: Complete a Competitive Analysis

### Website 1: doordash.engineering
- [doordash.engineering](https://doordash.engineering/)
- [Managing Supply and Demand Balance through Machine Learning](https://doordash.engineering/2021/06/29/managing-supply-and-demand-balance-through-machine-learning/)
- Analysis: There are plenty of graphs, supply and demand charts, and tables that are used throughout this site that I may try to recreate for my own purposes in my web app. The question mark and what follows in the link above is a query string regarding the parameters for the resource. A fragment follows a hash and refers to a specific section of a resource. However, a hash is not present in the links above. While inspecting this site, I noticed a division with a class for the theme in it. Under style, it has all the different fonts listed for that division in the site and all of the sizes of the fonts as well. I noticed a class that is applied to the header that I don’t know about. I am having trouble identifying what exactly is from bootstrap while analyzing this site.

### Website 2: uber.com
- [uber.com](https://www.uber.com/)
- [Supply Demand Big Data Platform](https://www.uber.com/blog/supply-demand-big-data-platform/)
- Analysis: I really like the design and layout of Uber’s main site. I also really like the utilization of the charts and graphs in the blog. I think it would be really cool to create a hybrid of both for my web app. I want to create something visually appealing like the home page, but also incorporate charts of data in different areas. I noticed a nav bar in the header of this site that I like. While inspecting uber.com, I saw that the nav bar was placed in the header from a css class. I found the following while inspecting the website: “<iframe id="_hjSafeContext_81873813" title="_hjSafeContext" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" src="about:blank" style="display: none !important; width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; opacity: 0 !important; pointer-events: none !important;"></iframe>”. I don’t quite understand what all is happening with this exactly, but I can clearly identify that website design is being done.

### Website 3: meteomatics.com
- [meteomatics.com](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/weather-api/)
- Analysis: The design and layout of this website stood out to me far more than the other sites that I am using. It feels very user friendly and easily navigable. It also looks really professional and has a good color scheme that I like. I would really like to replicate functionalities from this website like the nav bar and drop down menus that appear from them. I would also like to draw inspiration from the site as far as design and layout goes. When I inspect this site I notice immediately that there are a lot of div id’s and div classes. I see that the footer was made to be light-grey. “<footer class="bg-brand-light-gray pt-10 pb-2"><div class="container mx-auto px-5 md:px-0">”. I also found the following that I don’t fully understand: “<iframe owner="archetype" title="archetype" style="display: none; visibility: hidden;"></iframe>”. However, I can see that whatever this is, is hidden.

## Part 2: Complete GitHub Repository Research

### Repository 1: Netflix Home Page Using HTML and CSS
- [Repository](https://github.com/Alok-2002/Netflix_Home_Page_Using_HTML_And_CSS.git)
- Features: This repository looked very interesting to me as it mimics the Netflix home page and shows how to create it. There are multiple files in this repository that will be very useful to me. There is a style.css file containing all of the design as well as an index.html file that has all of the code that builds the web page. The README looks very organized and well done. It is broken down into multiple sections including a preview of the site, features, how to get started, contributions, license, acknowledgements, and contact information. I would like to break my READMEs down in a similar way.

### Repository 2: Responsive Layout Mastery
- [Repository](https://github.com/sukhmancs/responsive-layout-mastery.git)
- Features: This repository is comprised of a collection of projects that utilize html and css to show people how to create web pages. There are several different projects within this repository that I will look through to learn and gain inspiration from while building my own web pages. A couple of the projects are a responsive product landing page and a web form with validation. Some of the key features of this repository are css styling and a variety of web elements. The README for this repository is unique and shows just how creative you can get when making one. There are plenty of icons and pictures used in line with the content in the README. 

## Future Enhancements
- I am planning on adding a profitability page next to show how drivers from different areas with different climates can make more or less money than drivers in a different location.
- I would like to improve my skills with css to really make my website stand out and look better than it does in its current state.
- I want to learn more about javascript to add more unique functionalities to my website.
- I want to add a navbar or even a menu to make my site more easily navigable.

- ChatGPT was very beneficial for my javascript and css creation.
- The youtube videos were definitely my favorite source, because I feel like I learned the most from them.
- I did not face any challenges while trying to find sources to use for my project.
